\noindent
In $U(1)$ extensions of the minimal supersymmetric (SUSY) standard
model (MSSM) there is a simple mechanism that leads to a heavy $Z'$
with a mass which is substantially larger than the SUSY breaking
scale. This mechanism may also result in a pseudoscalar state so light
that the decays of the $125\,\mbox{GeV}$ SM-like Higgs boson into a
pair of such pseudoscalars can be kinematically allowed.  We study
these decays within $E_6$ inspired SUSY models with exact custodial
symmetry that forbids tree-level flavor-changing transitions and the
most dangerous baryon and lepton number violating operators. We argue
that the branching ratio of the lightest Higgs boson decays into a
pair of the light pseudoscalar states may not be negligibly small.

\section{Introduction}
Searches for physics beyond the standard model (SM) with ATLAS and CMS
have set rather stringent constraints on the masses of sparticles and
$Z'$ bosons. Indeed, in the case of the $E_6$ inspired models the LHC
data analysis excludes $Z'$ resonances with masses $M_{Z'}$ below
$2.5\,\mbox{TeV}$ \cite{1,2}. In the simplest $U(1)$ extensions of the
minimal supersymmetric (SUSY) standard model (MSSM) the extra $U(1)$
gauge symmetry is normally broken by the vacuum expectation value
(VEV) of the SM singlet superfield $S$ that carries non--zero $U(1)$
charges. Since $\langle S\rangle$ and $M_{Z'}$ are determined by the
SUSY breaking scale in these models the multi--TeV $Z'$ mass typically
implies that other sparticles also have multi--TeV masses.

 Since the third generation sfermions and Higgs bosons with sub–-TeV
 masses have not been ruled out by the LHC experiments yet it is worth
 to consider the phenomenological implications of the $U(1)$
 extensions of the MSSM in which the $Z'$ boson can be substantially
 heavier than the sparticles. Such scenarios may be realised when the
 extra $U(1)$ gauge symmetry is broken by two VEVs of the SM singlet
 superfields $S$ and $\overline{S}$ with opposite $U(1)$ charges.  In
 this case the extra $U(1)$ D--term contribution to the scalar
 potential may force the minimum of this potential to be along the
 $D$--flat direction (see, for example, \cite{Kolda:1995iw}).  As a
 consequence $\langle S\rangle$ and $\langle\overline{S}\rangle$ can
 be much larger than the SUSY breaking scale.

The simplest renormalizable superpotential of the SUSY model of the type discussed above
can be written as
\be
W_S=\sigma \phi S \overline{S}\,,
\label{hd1}
\ee
where $\phi$ is a scalar superfield that does not participate in gauge interactions. When
$\sigma$ goes to zero the corresponding tree--level scalar potential takes a form
\begin{equation}
V_S = m^2_S |S|^2 + m^2_{\overline{S}} |\overline{S}|^2 + m^2_{\phi} |\phi|^2
+\ds\frac{Q_S^2 g^{'2}_1}{2}\left(|S|^2-|\overline{S}|^2\right)^2\,,
\label{hd2}
\end{equation}
where $m_S^2$, $m^2_{\overline{S}}$ and $m^2_{\phi}$ are soft SUSY breaking
parameters and $Q_S$ is a $U(1)'$ charge of the SM singlet superfields $S$. In Eq.~(\ref{hd2})
the last term is associated with the extra $U(1)$ D--term contribution. In the limit
$\langle S \rangle = \langle \overline{S} \rangle$ this quartic term vanishes. If
$(m^2_S + m^2_{\overline{S}})<0$ then there is a run--away direction in this
model, so that $\langle S \rangle = \langle \overline{S} \rangle \to \infty$.
For small values $\sigma$ the interaction term in the superpotential (\ref{hd1}) stabilizes
the run-away direction and the SM singlet superfields tend to acquire large VEVs,
i.e
\be
\langle \phi \rangle \sim \langle S \rangle \simeq \langle \overline{S} \rangle
\sim \dfrac{1}{\sigma}\sqrt{|m^2_S + m^2_{\overline{S}}|}\,,
\label{hd3}
\ee
resulting in an extremely heavy $Z'$ boson.

Although the SUSY model mentioned above looks rather simple and elegant it
possess an additional accidental global $U(1)$ symmetry which can be
associated with the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry \cite{Peccei:1977hh}.
This symmetry is spontaneously broken by the VEVs of the SM singlet superfields
resulting in massless axion \cite{axion}. To avoid the appearance of axion
one needs to include in the superpotential (\ref{hd1}) polynomial terms with respect
to the superfield $\phi$ which explicitly break the global $U(1)$ symmetry. If the PQ
symmetry violating couplings are very small then the particle spectrum of this
SUSY model should contain a pseudo--Goldstone boson which can be considerably
lighter than all sparticles and Higgs bosons. In fact, the corresponding pseudoscalar
Higgs state may be so light that the SM-like Higgs boson decays into a pair of
these states can be kinematically allowed.

In this article we consider such nonstandard Higgs decays within the
well motivated $E_6$ inspired extensions of the MSSM. The breakdown of
the $E_6$ symmetry at high energies may lead to the models based on
rank--5 gauge groups with additional $U(1)'$ factor in comparison to
the SM. In this case extra $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry is a linear
combination of $U(1)_{\chi}$ and $U(1)_{\psi}$: \be
U(1)'=U(1)_{\chi}\cos\theta+U(1)_{\psi}\sin\theta\,,
\label{hd4}
\ee
which are defined by: $E_6\to SO(10)\times U(1)_{\psi},~SO(10)\to SU(5)\times U(1)_{\chi}$
(for a review see \cite{Langacker:2008yv}--\cite{E6-review}).  With additional Abelian gauge
symmetries it is important to ensure the cancellation of anomalies. In any model based on the
subgroup of $E_6$ anomalies are cancelled automatically if the low energy spectrum involves
complete $27$-plets. Consequently, in $E_6$ inspired SUSY models the particle spectrum is
extended to fill out three complete 27-dimensional representations of $E_6$. Each $27$--plet
contains one generation of ordinary matter; SM singlet field, $S_i$, that carries non--zero $U(1)'$
charge; up and down type Higgs doublets, $H^{u}_{i}$ and $H^{d}_{i}$; charged
$\pm 1/3$ exotic quarks $D_i$ and $\bar{D}_i$.

Different aspects of the phenomenology of the $E_6$ inspired SUSY models have been
extensively studied over the years \cite{E6-review}--\cite{E6}. A few years ago the Tevatron
and early LHC $Z'$ mass limits in these models have been discussed in \cite{Accomando:2010fz}
and collider signatures associated with the exotic quarks and squarks have been considered
in \cite{Kang:2007ib}. Previously, the implications of $E_6$ inspired SUSY models with an
additional $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry have been studied for electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking
(EWSB) \cite{Langacker:1998tc}--\cite{Daikoku:2000ep}, neutrino physics \cite{Kang:2004ix}--\cite{Ma:1995xk},
leptogenesis \cite{Hambye:2000bn}--\cite{King:2008qb},
EW baryogenesis \cite{baryogen}, muon anomalous magnetic moment \cite{g-2}, electric
dipole moment of electron \cite{Suematsu:1997tv} and tau lepton \cite{GutierrezRodriguez:2006hb},
lepton flavour violating processes like $\mu\to e\gamma$ \cite{Suematsu:1997qt} and CP-violation in the
Higgs sector \cite{Ham:2008fx}. The neutralino sector in $E_6$ inspired SUSY models was analysed
in \cite{Keith:1997zb}, \cite{Suematsu:1997tv}--\cite{Suematsu:1997qt},
\cite{Suematsu:1997au}--\cite{E6neutralino-higgs}.  Such models have also been proposed as
the solution to the tachyon problems of anomaly mediated SUSY breaking, via $U(1)^\prime$ D-term
contributions \cite{Asano:2008ju}, and used in combination with a generation symmetry to construct
a model explaining fermion mass hierarchy and mixing \cite{Stech:2008wd}. The Higgs sector and
the theoretical upper bound on the lightest Higgs boson mass in the $E_6$ inspired SUSY models
were examined in \cite{Daikoku:2000ep}, \cite{E6neutralino-higgs}, \cite{King:2005jy}--\cite{E6-higgs}.

Here we focus on the $E_6$ inspired SUSY extension of the SM based on
the low--energy SM gauge group together with an extra $U(1)_{N}$ gauge
symmetry in which right--handed neutrinos do not participate in the
gauge interactions. This corresponds to $\theta=\arctan\sqrt{15}$.
Only in this Exceptional Supersymmetric Standard Model (E$_6$SSM)
\cite{King:2005jy}--\cite{King:2005my} right--handed neutrinos may be
superheavy, shedding light on the origin of the mass hierarchy in the
lepton sector and providing a mechanism for the generation of the
baryon asymmetry in the Universe via leptogenesis
\cite{Hambye:2000bn}--\cite{King:2008qb}. $E_6$ inspired SUSY models
with an additional $U(1)_{N}$ gauge symmetry have been studied in
\cite{Ma:1995xk} in the context of non--standard neutrino models with
extra singlets, in \cite{Suematsu:1997au} from the point of view of
$Z-Z'$ mixing, in \cite{Keith:1997zb} and
\cite{Suematsu:1997au}--\cite{Keith:1996fv} where the neutralino
sector was explored, in \cite{Keith:1997zb}, \cite{King:2007uj} where
the renormalisation group (RG) flow of couplings was examined and in
\cite{Suematsu:1994qm}--\cite{Daikoku:2000ep} where EWSB was
studied. The presence of a $Z'$ boson and of exotic quarks predicted
by the E$_6$SSM provides spectacular new physics signals at the LHC
which were analysed in \cite{King:2005jy}--\cite{Accomando:2006ga},
\cite{Howl:2007zi}. The presence of light exotic particles also lead
to the nonstandard decays of the SM--like Higgs boson that were
discussed in detail in \cite{Nevzorov:2013tta}--\cite{Hall:2010ix}.
Recently the particle spectrum and collider signatures associated with
it were studied within the constrained version of the E$_6$SSM
\cite{cE6SSM}. The degree of fine tuning in the constrained version has has been examined recently \cite{Athron:2013ipa}. The threshold corrections to the running gauge and
Yukawa couplings in the E$_6$SSM and cE$_6$SSM were studied in detail
in \cite{Athron:2012pw}. Alternative boundary conditions which are shifted by D-terms from the highscale breakdown of the U(1) gauge symmetry which doesn't survive to low energies have been considered in the context of using a measuremet of the first or second generation sefermion masses to constrain the GUT scale parameters\cite{Miller:2012vn}. The renormalization of VEVs in the E$_6$SSM
was considered in \cite{Sperling:2013eva}.

The presence of exotic matter in the E$_6$SSM generically lead to non--diagonal flavour transitions and rapid proton
decay. To suppress these processes one can impose a set of discrete symmetries \cite{King:2005jy}--\cite{King:2005my}.
In this article we study the nonstandard Higgs decays mentioned above within the $E_6$ inspired SUSY models
with the extra $U(1)_{N}$ factor in which a single discrete $\tilde{Z}^{H}_2$ symmetry forbids tree--level
flavor--changing transitions and the most dangerous baryon and lepton number violating operators \cite{nevzorov}.
In particular, we consider scenarios with approximate global $U(1)$ symmetry that leads to a pseudo--Goldstone
boson in the particle spectrum. Since no indication for the presence of SUSY particles has been observed we
assume that the SUSY breaking parameters are of the order of $1\,\mbox{TeV}$ or even larger. The pseudo--Goldstone
state in these scenarios is mainly a linear superposition of the imaginary parts of the scalar components of the
SM singlet superfields $\phi$, $S$ and $\overline{S}$. Although one can expect that the coupling of this state
to the SM--like Higgs boson, which is predominantly a linear superposition of the neutral components of the Higgs
doublets $H_u$ and $H_{d}$, is somewhat suppressed it can still lead to the non--negligible branching ratio of the
lightest Higgs decays into a pair of pseudo--Goldstone bosons.

In this context it is worth noting that the decay rate of the SM-like Higgs state into a pair of pseudoscalars were
intensively studied within the simplest extension of the MSSM ---  Next--to--Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
(NMSSM) (for the reviews of nonstandard Higgs boson decays see \cite{Chang:2008cw}). The NMSSM superpotential
is given by \cite{review-nmssm}:
\begin{equation}
W_{NMSSM}=\lambda S(H_d H_u)+\dfrac{\kappa}{3} S^3 + W_{MSSM}(\mu=0)\,.
\label{hd5}
\end{equation}
In the limit $\kappa= 0$ the Lagrangian of the NMSSM is invariant under the transformations of the
PQ symmetry that leads to the massless axion when it is spontaneously broken by the VEV $\langle S\rangle$.
If $\kappa$ is rather small then the NMSSM particle spectrum involves one light scalar and one light pseudoscalar
states. In addition if $\kappa\to 0$ and the SUSY breaking scale is of the order of $\mbox{TeV}$
the lightest SUSY particle (LSP) is the lightest neutralino $\tilde{\chi}^0_1$ which is predominantly singlino.
In this case the LSP couplings to the SM particles are quite small resulting in a relatively small annihilation cross
section for $\tilde{\chi}^0_1\tilde{\chi}^0_1\to \mbox{SM particles}$ which gives rise to a relic density that is
typically much larger than its measured value. As a consequence it seems to be rather problematic to find
phenomenologically viable scenarios with light pseudoscalar in the case of the NMSSM with approximate PQ symmetry.
Nevertheless the sufficiently light pseudoscalar can be always obtained by tuning the parameters of the NMSSM.

In contrast with the NMSSM the mass of the lightest neutralino in the
SUSY model considered here does not become small when the PQ symmetry
violating couplings vanish. Moreover, even when all PQ symmetry
violating couplings are negligibly small, the LSP can be
higgsino--like, which allows a reasonable value for the dark matter
density to be obtained if LSP has a mass below $1\,\mbox{TeV}$ (see,
for example \cite{ArkaniHamed:2006mb}). Thus the approximate PQ
symmetry can lead to phenomenologically viable scenarios with light
pseudoscalar in this model.

The paper is organised as follows. In the next section we briefly review the $E_6$ inspired SUSY models with exact
custodial $\tilde{Z}^{H}_2$ symmetry. In section 3 the breakdown of gauge symmetry and Higgs phenomenology
are studied. In section 4 we discuss a set of benchmark scenarios that leads to the decays of the lightest Higgs boson
into a pair of pseudoscalar states. Our results are summarised in section 5. In Appendix A the spectrum of neutralino
states is examined.



\section{$E_6$ inspired SUSY models with exact $\tilde{Z}^{H}_2$ symmetry}

In this section, we briefly review the $E_6$ inspired SUSY models with
exact custodial $\tilde{Z}^{H}_2$ symmetry \cite{nevzorov}, which we
use to demonstrate how light pseudoscalar states can appear in SUSY
models with an extra $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry and what kind of Higgs
decay rates they can lead to.  These models imply that $E_6$ or its
subgroup is broken down to $SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_W\times U(1)_Y\times
U(1)_{\psi}\times U(1)_{\chi}$ near the Grand Unification scale $M_X$
(GUT scale). Below scale $M_X$ the particle content of these SUSY
models involves three copies of $27_i$--plets and a set of $M_{l}$ and
$\overline{M}_l$ supermultiplets from the incomplete $27'_l$ and
$\overline{27'}_l$ representations of $E_6$. All components of the
complete $27_i$--plets are odd under $\tilde{Z}^{H}_2$ discrete
symmetry, while the supermultiplets $\overline{M}_l$ can be either odd
or even. The supermultiplets $M_{l}$ are even under the
$\tilde{Z}^{H}_2$ symmetry and as a consequence they can be used for
the breakdown of gauge symmetry. To ensure that the $SU(2)_W\times
U(1)_Y\times U(1)_{\psi}\times U(1)_{\chi}$ symmetry is broken down to
$U(1)_{em}$ associated with the electromagnetism the set of multiplets
$M_{l}$ should involve $H_u$, $H_d$, $S$ and $N^c_H$.  Just below the
GUT scale $U(1)_{\psi}\times U(1)_{\chi}$ gauge symmetry is expected
to be broken by the VEVs of $N^c_H$ and $\overline{N}_H^c$ down to
$U(1)_{N}\times Z_{2}^{M}$ in these $E_6$ inspired models, where
$Z_{2}^{M}=(-1)^{3(B-L)}$ is a matter parity. This is possible because
matter parity is a discrete subgroup of $U(1)_{\psi}$ and
$U(1)_{\chi}$. Due to such breakdown of $U(1)_{\psi}$ and
$U(1)_{\chi}$ gauge symmetries all exotic states which originate from
$27_i$ representations of $E_6$ as well as ordinary quark and lepton
states survive to low energies. In general the large VEVs $\langle
N^c_H \rangle \sim \langle \overline{N}_H^c \rangle \lesssim M_X$ also
induce the large Majorana masses for right-handed neutrinos allowing
them to be used for the see--saw mechanism.  Since $N^c_H$ and
$\overline{N}_H^c$ acquire VEVs both supermultiplets should be even
under the imposed $\tilde{Z}^{H}_2$ symmetry.

At the TeV scale the superfields $H_u$, $H_d$ and $S$ play the role of
Higgs fields. The VEVs of these superfields break the $SU(2)_W\times
U(1)_Y\times U(1)_{N}$ gauge symmetry down to $U(1)_{em}$.  Because of
this the supermultiplets $H_u$, $H_d$ and $S$ should be also even
under the $\tilde{Z}^{H}_2$ symmetry.  In contrast, in the simplest
scenario $\overline{H}_u$ and $\overline{H}_d$ are expected to be odd
under this custodial symmetry so that they can get combined with the
superposition of the corresponding components from the $27_i$, forming
vectorlike states that gain masses of order of $M_X$.  The superfield
$\overline{S}$ may also acquire non--zero VEV breaking $U(1)_{N}$
symmetry. If this is a case then $\overline{S}$ has to be even under
the $\tilde{Z}^{H}_2$ symmetry. When $\overline{S}$ is odd under the
$\tilde{Z}^{H}_2$ symmetry then it can get combined with the
superposition of the appropriate components of $27_i$ resulting in
formation of superheavy vectorlike states with masses $\sim M_X$.  The
custodial $\tilde{Z}^{H}_2$ symmetry allows the Yukawa interactions in
the superpotential that originate from $27'_l \times 27'_m \times
27'_n$ and $27'_l \times 27_i \times 27_k$. It is easy to check that
the corresponding set of operators does not contain any that lead to
the rapid proton decay. Since the set of multiplets $M_{l}$ contains
only one pair of doublets $H_d$ and $H_u$ the down-type quarks and
charged leptons couple to just one Higgs doublet $H_d$, whereas the
up-type quarks couple to $H_u$ only. As a result the flavor--changing
processes are forbidden at the tree level.

Nonetheless if the set of $\tilde{Z}^{H}_2$ even supermultiplets
$M_{l}$ involve only $H_u$, $H_d$, $S$ and $N^c_H$ then the Lagrangian
of the model is invariant not only with respect to $U(1)_B$ but also
under $U(1)_D$ symmetry transformations \be D\to e^{i\alpha}
D\,,\qquad\qquad \overline{D}\to e^{-i\alpha}\overline{D}\,.
\label{hd6}
\ee
The $U(1)_D$ symmetry ensures that the lightest exotic quark is very long--lived.
Indeed, as $U(1)_B$ the $U(1)_D$ global symmetry is expected to be broken by a set of non--renormalizable
operators which are suppressed by inverse power of $M_X$ or $M_{Pl}$. These operators allow the lightest
exotic quark to decay. However its lifetime tends to be considerably larger than the age of the Universe.
So long--lived exotic quarks would have been produced during the very early epochs of the Big Bang.
Those lightest exotic quark states which survive annihilation would subsequently have been confined
in heavy hadrons forming nuclear isotopes that should be present in terrestrial matter. Various theoretical
estimations \cite{43} show that if such stable relics in the mass range from $1\,\mbox{GeV}$ to $10\,\mbox{TeV}$
would exist in nature today their concentration is expected to be at the level of $10^{-10}$ per nucleon.
At the same time different experiments set strong upper limits on the relative concentrations of such
nuclear isotopes from $10^{-15}$ to $10^{-30}$ per nucleon \cite{42}. Therefore $E_6$ inspired models
with very long--lived exotic quarks are ruled out.

To ensure that the lightest exotic quarks decay within a reasonable time in the simplest scenario
the set of $\tilde{Z}^{H}_2$ even supermultiplets $M_{l}$ is supplemented by $L_4$, where $L_4$ and
$\overline{L}_4$ are lepton $SU(2)_W$ doublet supermultiplets that originate from a pair of additional
$27'_{L}$ and $\overline{27'}_L$. The supermultiplets $L_4$ and $\overline{L}_4$ should form TeV scale
vectorlike states to render the lightest exotic quark unstable\footnote{The appropriate mass term
$\mu_L L_4\overline{L}_4$ in the superpotential can be induced within SUGRA models just after the
breakdown of local SUSY if the K\"ahler potential contains an extra term $(Z_L (L_4\overline{L}_4)+h.c)$\cite{45}.}.
Therefore $L_4$ and $\overline{L}_4$ have to be both even under the $\tilde{Z}^{H}_2$ symmetry.
In this case the baryon and lepton number conservation implies that exotic quarks are leptoquarks.

Here we assume that in addition to $H_u$, $H_d$, $S$, $L_4$,
$\overline{L}_4$ $N^c_H$ and $\overline{N}_H^c$ the particle spectrum
below scale $M_X$ involves $\tilde{Z}^{H}_2$ even superfields
$\overline{S}$ and $\phi$, where superfield $\phi$ does not
participate in the $SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_W\times U(1)_Y\times
U(1)_{\psi}\times U(1)_{\chi}$ gauge interactions but acquires
non--zero VEVs. Taking into account that the components of the
superfields $\overline{S}$ and $\phi$ are expected to gain
$\mbox{TeV}$ scale masses whereas the right--handed neutrino
superfields are superheavy, the low energy matter content in the $E_6$
inspired SUSY models discussed above involves: \be \ba{c}
3\left[(Q_i,\,u^c_i,\,d^c_i,\,L_i,\,e^c_i)\right]
+3(D_i,\,\bar{D}_i)+3(S_{i})+2(H^u_{\alpha})+2(H^d_{\alpha})\\[2mm]
+L_4+\overline{L}_4+S+\overline{S}+H_u+H_d+\phi\,, \ea
\label{hd7}
\ee
where $\alpha=1,2$ and $i=1,2,3$. Neglecting all suppressed non-renormalisable interactions
the low-energy effective superpotential of these models can be written as
\be
\ba{rcl}
W &=& \lambda S (H_u H_d) - \sigma \phi S \overline{S} + \dfrac{\kappa}{3}\phi^3+\dfrac{\mu}{2}\phi^2+\Lambda\phi\\[2mm]
&&+ \lambda_{\alpha\beta} S (H^d_{\alpha} H^u_{\beta})+ \kappa_{ij} S (D_{i} \overline{D}_{j}) + \tilde{f}_{i\alpha} S_{i} (H^d_{\alpha} H_u)
+ f_{i\alpha} S_{i} (H_d H^u_{\alpha}) \\[2mm]
&&+ g^D_{ij} (Q_i L_4) \overline{D}_j+ h^E_{i\alpha} e^c_{i} (H^d_{\alpha} L_4) + \mu_L L_4\overline{L}_4+
\tilde{\sigma} \phi L_4\overline{L}_4+ W_{MSSM}(\mu=0)\,.
\ea
\label{hd8}
\ee

The gauge group and field content of the $E_6$ inspired SUSY models under consideration
can originate from the 5D and 6D orbifold GUT models in which the splitting of GUT
multiplets can be naturally achieved \cite{nevzorov}. In these orbifold GUT models
all GUT relations between the Yukawa couplings can get spoiled while the approximate
unification of the SM gauge couplings should take place. From Eq.~(\ref{hd7}) it follows
that extra matter beyond the MSSM fill in complete $SU(5)$ representations in these
models. As a consequence the gauge coupling unification remains almost exact in the
one--loop approximation. It was also shown that in the two--loop approximation the unification
of the gauge couplings in the SUSY models under consideration can be achieved for any
phenomenologically acceptable value of $\alpha_3(M_Z)$, consistent with the central
measured low energy value \cite{nevzorov}, \cite{King:2007uj}.

\caption{Transformation properties of different components of $E_6$ multiplets
under $\tilde{Z}^H_2$, $Z_{2}^{M}$ and $Z_{2}^{E}$ discrete symmetries.}
\label{tab-hd1}
\end{table}

For the analysis of the phenomenological implications of SUSY models discussed
above it is convenient to introduce $Z_{2}^{E}$ symmetry which is defined so that
$\tilde{Z}^{H}_2 = Z_{2}^{M}\times Z_{2}^{E}$. The transformation properties
of different components of $27_i$, $27'_l$ and $\overline{27'}_l$ supermultiplets under
the $\tilde{Z}^{H}_2$, $Z_{2}^{M}$ and $Z_{2}^{E}$ symmetries are summarized
in Table~\ref{tab-hd1}. Since the low--energy effective Lagrangian of the $E_6$ inspired
SUSY models studied here is invariant under the transformations of $Z_{2}^{M}$ and
$\tilde{Z}^{H}_2$ symmetries, the $Z_{2}^{E}$ symmetry associated with the exotic
states is also conserved. The invariance of the Lagrangian under the $Z_{2}^{E}$ symmetry
implies that in collider experiments the exotic particles, which are odd under this symmetry,
can only be created in pairs and the lightest exotic state should be absolutely stable.
Using the method proposed in \cite{Hesselbach:2007te} it was argued that the masses
of the lightest inert neutralino states\footnote{We use the terminology ``Inert Higgs'' to
denote Higgs--like doublets and SM singlets that do not develop VEVs. The fermionic components
of these supermultiplets form inert neutralino and chargino states.}, which are predominantly linear
superpositions of the fermion components of the superfields $S_i$ from complete $27_i$
representations of $E_6$, do not exceed $60-65\,\mbox{GeV}$ \cite{Hall:2010ix}.
Because of this the corresponding states tend to be the lightest exotic particles in the spectrum.

The presence of lightest exotic particles with masses below $60\,\mbox{GeV}$ gives rise to
new decay channels of the SM--like Higgs boson. Moreover if these states are heavier
than $5-10\,\mbox{GeV}$ then the SM--like Higgs state decays predominantly into the
lightest inert neutralinos while the total branching ratio into SM particles gets strongly suppressed.
Nowadays such scenarios are basically ruled out. On the other hand if the lightest exotic particles
have masses below $5\,\mbox{GeV}$ their couplings to the SM--like Higgs state, gauge bosons,
quarks and leptons are very small. This allows to avoid problems with nonstandard Higgs
decays but it results in the cold dark matter density which is much larger than its measured value
because the corresponding annihilation cross section tends to be rather small.
The simplest phenomenologically viable scenarios imply that the lightest inert neutralinos
are substantially lighter than $1\,\mbox{eV}$\footnote{The presence of very light neutral fermions
in the particle spectrum might have interesting implications for the neutrino physics (see, for
example \cite{Frere:1996gb}).}. This can be achieved if $f_{\alpha\beta}\sim \tilde{f}_{\alpha\beta}\lesssim 10^{-6}$
In this case the lightest exotic particles form hot dark matter (dark radiation) in the Universe
but give only a very minor contribution to the dark matter density.

The $Z_{2}^{M}$ symmetry conservation ensures that $R$--parity is also conserved in the SUSY models
discussed above. Because the lightest exotic state is the lightest $R$--parity odd state either the lightest
$R$--parity even exotic state or the lightest $R$--parity odd state with $Z_{2}^{E}=+1$ must be
stable. In the $E_6$ inspired models studied here most commonly the lightest ordinary neutralino state
($Z_{2}^{E}=+1$) tend to be absolutely stable. As in the MSSM this state may account for all or some
of the observed cold dark matter density.

As mentioned before, in the simplest case the sector responsible for the breakdown of the
$SU(2)_W\times U(1)_Y\times U(1)_{N}$ gauge symmetry involves $H_u$, $H_d$ and $S$. In this case
the Higgs sector of the $E_6$ inspired SUSY models with the extra $U(1)_{N}$ factor was explored in \cite{King:2005jy}.
If CP--invariance is preserved then the Higgs spectrum in these models contains three CP--even, one CP--odd
and two charged states.  The singlet dominated CP--even state is always almost degenerate with the $Z'$ gauge
boson. In contrast with the MSSM, the lightest Higgs boson in these models can be heavier than $110-120\,\mbox{GeV}$
even at tree level. In the two--loop approximation the lightest Higgs boson mass does not exceed $150-155\,\mbox{GeV}$
\cite{King:2005jy}. Recently, the RG flow of the Yukawa couplings and the theoretical upper bound on
the lightest Higgs boson mass in these models were analysed in the vicinity of the quasi--fixed point \cite{Nevzorov:2013ixa}
that appears as a result of the intersection of the invariant and quasi--fixed lines \cite{Nevzorov:2001vj}.
It was argued that near the quasi--fixed point the upper bound on the mass of the SM--like Higgs boson is
rather close to $125\,\mbox{GeV}$ \cite{Nevzorov:2013ixa}.

The qualitative pattern of the Higgs spectrum
in the $E_6$ inspired SUSY models with the extra $U(1)_{N}$ gauge symmetry and minimal Higgs sector
is determined by the Yukawa coupling $\lambda$. When $\lambda < g'_1$, where $g'_1$ is a gauge coupling
associated with the $U(1)_{N}$ gauge symmetry, the singlet dominated CP--even state is very heavy and
decouple from the rest of the spectrum making it indistinguishable from the one in the MSSM. If $\lambda\gtrsim g'_1$
the Higgs spectrum has extremely hierarchical structure which is rather similar to the one that arises in the NMSSM
with the approximate PQ symmetry \cite{Miller:2005qua}--\cite{Nevzorov:2004ge}. As a consequence
the mass matrix of the CP--even Higgs sector can be diagonalized using the perturbation theory
\cite{Nevzorov:2004ge}--\cite{Nevzorov:2001um}. In this case the mass of the second lightest CP--even
Higgs state is set by the $Z'$ boson mass while the heaviest CP--even, CP--odd and charged states
are almost degenerate and lie beyond the multi TeV range.


\section{Higgs sector}
\subsection{The Higgs potential and gauge symmetry breaking}

As it was mentioned in the previous section the sector responsible for the breakdown of gauge symmetry in the SUSY
model under consideration includes two Higgs doublets $H_u$ and $H_d$ as well as the SM singlet fields $S$,
$\overline{S}$ and $\phi$. The interactions between these fields are determined by the structure of the gauge
interactions and by the superpotential in Eq.~(\ref{hd8}). The resulting Higgs effective potential is the sum
of four pieces:
\be
\ba{rcl}
V&=&V_F+V_D+V_{soft}+\Delta V\, ,\\[2mm]
V_F&=&\lambda^2|S|^2(|H_d|^2+|H_u|^2) + \left|\lambda (H_d H_u) - \sigma \phi \overline{S}\right|^2
+ \sigma^2 |\phi|^2 |S|^2 + \\[2mm]
& + &\left| - \sigma (S \overline{S}) + \kappa \phi^2 + \mu \phi + \Lambda \right|^2\,,\\[2mm]
V_D&=&\ds\frac{g_2^2}{8}\left(H_d^\dagger \sigma_a H_d+H_u^\dagger \sigma_a H_u\right)^2
+\frac{{g'}^2}{8}\left(|H_d|^2-|H_u|^2\right)^2+\\[2mm]
&&+\ds\frac{g^{'2}_1}{2}\left(\tilde{Q}_{H_d} |H_d|^2+\tilde{Q}_{H_u} |H_u|^2+\tilde{Q}_S |S|^2 - \tilde{Q}_S |\overline{S}|^2 \right)^2\,,\\[2mm]
V_{soft}&=&m_{S}^2 |S|^2 + m_{\overline{S}}^2 |\overline{S}|^2 + m_1^2|H_d|^2 + m_2^2|H_u|^2 +
m^2_{\varphi}|\phi|^2+ \biggl[\lambda A_{\lambda} S (H_u H_d) \\[2mm]
&-& \sigma A_{\sigma} \phi (S \overline{S}) + \dfrac{\kappa}{3} A_{\kappa} \phi^3 + B\dfrac{\mu}{2} \phi^2 + \xi \Lambda \phi + h.c.\biggr]\,,
\ea
\label{hd9}
\ee
where $H_d^T=(H_d^0,\,H_d^{-})$, $H_u^T=(H_u^{+},\,H_u^{0})$ and $(H_d H_u)=H_u^{+}H_d^{-}-H_u^{0}H_d^{0}$,
while $\tilde{Q}_{H_d}$, $\tilde{Q}_{H_u}$ and $\tilde{Q}_S$ are effective $U(1)$ charges of $H_d$, $H_u$ and $S$.
At tree--level the Higgs potential in Eq.~(\ref{hd9}) is described by the sum of the first three terms. $V_F$ and $V_D$ contain
$F$--term and $D$--term contributions that do not violate SUSY. The terms in the expression for $V_D$ are proportional to
the $SU(2)_W$, $U(1)_Y$ and $U(1)_{N}$ gauge couplings, i.e. $g_2,\,g'$ and $g'_1$ respectively. The values of the gauge couplings
$g_2$ and $g'$ at the EW scale are well known, whereas the low--energy value of the extra $U(1)_{N}$ coupling $g'_1$ and the effective
$U(1)_{N}$ charges of $H_d$, $H_u$ and $S$ can be calculated assuming gauge coupling unification \cite{King:2005jy}.
The soft SUSY breaking terms are collected in $V_{soft}$. A set of soft SUSY breaking parameters in the tree--level Higgs boson
potential includes the soft masses $m_1^2,\,m_2^2,\,m_{S}^2$,\, $m_{\overline{S}}^2$ and $m^2_{\varphi}$; the trilinear
couplings $A_{\lambda}$, $A_{\sigma}$ and $A_{\kappa}$; the bilinear coupling $B$ and linear coupling $\xi$.
The term $\Delta V$ in Eq.~(\ref{hd9}) is associated with the contribution of loop corrections to the Higgs effective potential.
In SUSY models the most significant contribution to $\Delta V$ comes from the loops involving the top--quark and its superpartners.

At the physical minimum of the scalar potential (\ref{hd9}) the Higgs fields develop VEVs

where $\bar{g}=\sqrt{g_2^2+g'^2}$. Instead of $v_1$, $v_2$, $s_1$ and $s_2$ it is more convenient to use $\tan\beta=v_2/v_1$,
$v=\sqrt{v_1^2+v_2^2}=246\,\mbox{GeV}$, $s=\sqrt{s_1^2+s_2^2}$ and $\tan\theta=s_2/s_1$.

Initially the Higgs sector involves fourteen degrees of freedom. However four of them are massless Goldstone modes.
They are swallowed by the $W^{\pm}$, $Z$ and $Z'$ gauge bosons. The charged $W^{\pm}$ bosons gain masses
via the interaction with the neutral components of the Higgs doublets $H_u$ and $H_d$ just in the same way as in the
MSSM resulting in $M_W=\dfrac{g_2}{2}v$. On the other hand the mechanism of the neutral gauge boson mass
generation differs substantially. Letting $Z'$ and $Z$ states be the gauge bosons associated with $U(1)_{N}$ and
SM--like $Z$ boson the $Z-Z'$ mass squared matrix is given by
\be
M^2_{ZZ'}=\left(
\ba{cc}
\dfrac{\bar{g}^2}{4} v^2  & \Delta^2 \\[2mm]
\Delta^2  & g^{'2}_1v^2\biggl(\tilde{Q}_{H_d}^2\cos^2\beta+\tilde{Q}_{H_u}^2\sin^2\beta\biggr) + g^{'2}_1 \tilde{Q}^2_S s^2
\ea
\right)\,,

\ee
where
$$
\Delta^2=\ds\frac{\bar{g}g'_1}{2}v^2\biggl(\tilde{Q}_{H_d}\cos^2\beta-\tilde{Q}_{H_u}\sin^2\beta\biggr)\,.
$$
Since fields $S$ and $\overline{S}$ must acquire large VEVs, i.e. $s_1\simeq s_2 \gg 1\,\mbox{TeV}$ to ensure
that the extra $U(1)_{N}$ gauge boson is heavy enough, the mass of the lightest neutral gauge boson $Z_1$ is very close
to $M_Z=\bar{g}v/2$ whereas the mass of $Z_2$ is set by $g'_1\tilde{Q}_S\, s$.

\subsection{Higgs boson spectrum}

For the analysis of the Higgs boson spectrum we use the equations for the extrema (\ref{hd11}) to express the soft masses
$m_1^2,\,m_2^2,\,m_{S}^2$,\, $m_{\overline{S}}^2$ and $m^2_{\varphi}$ in terms of $s,\,v,\,\varphi,\, \beta,\, \theta$
and other parameters. Because of the electric--charge conservation the charged components of the Higgs doublets are not
mixed with neutral Higgs fields. They form a separate sector whose spectrum is described by a $2\times 2$ mass matrix.
The determinant of this matrix has zero value resulting in the appearance of two Goldstone states
\be
G^{-}=H_d^{-}\cos\beta-H_u^{+*}\sin\beta\,,
\label{hd13}
\ee
which are absorbed into the longitudinal degrees of freedom of the $W^{\pm}$ gauge boson, and two physical states
\be
H^{+}=H_d^{-*}\sin\beta+H_u^{+}\cos\beta
\label{hd14}
\ee
with mass
\be
m^2_{H^{\pm}}=\dfrac{\sqrt{2}\lambda s}{\sin 2\beta}\left(A_{\lambda} \cos\theta - \dfrac{\sigma \varphi}{\sqrt{2}}\sin\theta\right)
-\frac{\lambda^2}{2}v^2+\frac{g_2^2}{4}v^2+\Delta_{\pm}\,,
\label{hd15}
\ee
where $\Delta_{\pm}$ is a contribution of loop corrections to $m^2_{H^{\pm}}$.

The imaginary parts of the neutral components of the Higgs doublets and imaginary parts of the SM singlet fields
$S$, $\overline{S}$ and $\phi$ compose two Goldstone states
\be
\ba{l}
G=\sqrt{2}(\mbox{Im}\,H_d^0\cos\beta - \mbox{Im}\, H_u^0\sin\beta)\,,\\[1mm]
G'=\sqrt{2}(\mbox{Im}\,S \cos\theta - \mbox{Im}\,\overline{S}\sin\theta)\cos\gamma - \sqrt{2}(\mbox{Im}\,H_u^0\cos\beta + \mbox{Im}\,H_d^0\sin\beta)\sin\gamma\,,
\ea
\label{hd16}
\ee
which are swallowed by the $Z$ and $Z'$ bosons, as well as three physical states.

In Eqs.~(\ref{hd19}) $\tilde{\Delta}_{ij}$ correspond to the contribution of loop corrections. Because in the models under consideration $s$ must be much larger
than $v$, $\gamma$ goes to zero. Moreover since in phenomenologically acceptable SUSY models the supersymmetry breaking scale also tends
to be considerably larger than $v$ the mixing between $P_1$ and pseudoscalar states which are mainly the linear superpositions of the imaginary
parts of the SM singlet fields $S$, $\overline{S}$ and $\phi$, i.e. $P_2$ and $P_3$, is somewhat suppressed. In other words the off--diagonal entries
$\tilde{M}_{12}^2,\, \tilde{M}_{13}^2\ll \tilde{M}_{11}^2$ that allows to diagonalize the mass matrix (\ref{hd18})--(\ref{hd19}) analytically.
In particular, the mass of the one of the CP--odd Higgs eigenstate, which is predominantly $P_1$, is set by $\tilde{M}_{11}^2$. As a consequence
this CP--odd state and the charged physical Higgs states are nearly degenerate in general.

The mass matrix (\ref{hd18})--(\ref{hd19}) can be diagonalized by means of unitary transformation that relates the components of the CP--odd
Higgs basis (\ref{hd17}) to the corresponding Higgs mass eigenstates:
\be
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
P_1\\ P_2\\ P_3
\end{array}
\right)=
U
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
A_1 \\ A_2\\ A_3
\end{array}
\right)\,,
\label{hd20}
\ee
where the pseudoscalar mass eigenstates are labeled according to increasing absolute value of mass, with $A_1$ being the lightest
CP--odd Higgs state and $A_3$ the heaviest. In the limit when the couplings $\kappa$, $\mu$ and $\Lambda$, which violate the global $U(1)$
symmetry discussed previously, vanish, the mass of the lightest CP--odd Higgs boson goes to zero. Neglecting all terms proportional to $\lambda v$
and $\tilde{\Delta}_{ij}$ one obtains

In Eq.~(\ref{hd25}) $\Delta_{ij}$ represent the contribution of loop corrections. The components of the CP--even Higgs basis (\ref{hd23})
are related to the physical CP--even Higgs eigenstates by virtue of a unitary transformation:
\be
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
S_1\\S_2\\ S_3\\ S_4\\ S_5
\end{array}
\right)=
\tilde{U}
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
h_1 \\ h_2\\ h_3 \\ h_4\\ h_5
\end{array}
\right)\,,
\label{hd26}
\ee
where again the CP--even Higgs eigenstates are labeled according to increasing absolute value of mass,
with $h_1$ being the lightest CP--even Higgs state and $h_5$ the heaviest.

If all SUSY breaking parameters as well as $\lambda s \sim \sigma s \sim \sigma \varphi \sim M_{S}$
are considerably larger than the EW scale, all masses of the CP--even Higgs states except the lightest Higgs
boson mass are determined by the SUSY breaking scale $M_S$.
Because the minimal eigenvalue of the mass matrix (\ref{hd24})--(\ref{hd25})
is always less than its smallest diagonal element the lightest Higgs state in the CP--even sector (approximately $S_5$)
remains always light irrespective of the SUSY breaking scale, i.e. $m^2_{h_1}\lesssim M_{55}^2$ like in the MSSM
and NMSSM.  In the interactions with other SM particles this state manifests itself as a SM--like Higgs boson
if $M_S \gg M_Z$.

In the limit when $\lambda \sim \sigma \to 0 $  the off--diagonal entries $M_{24}^2$, $M_{25}^2$, $M_{34}^2$
and $M_{35}^2$ of the mass matrix (\ref{hd24})--(\ref{hd25}) become negligibly small. At the same time
according to Eq.~(\ref{hd3}) the diagonal entry $M_{11}^2$, which is set by the mass of the $Z'$ boson, tends
to be substantially larger than $M_S^2$, i.e. $M_{11}^2\simeq M_{Z'}^2 \sim M_S^2/\sigma^2$, whereas
$\cos 2\theta$ almost vanishes in this case. Indeed, combining the first and the second equations for the extrema
(\ref{hd11}) one obtains the following tree-level expression for $\cos 2\theta$
\be
\cos 2\theta \simeq
\dfrac{m_{\overline{S}}^2-m_{S}^2}{m_{\overline{S}}^2+m_S^2+\sigma^2\varphi^2+g^{'2}_1 \tilde{Q}_S^2 s^2}
\sim \dfrac{M_S^2}{M_{Z'}^2}\sim \sigma^2\,,
\label{hd27}
\ee
that becomes vanishingly small when $M_{Z'}\gg M_S$ and/or $\sigma\sim \lambda\to 0$. In this case the  hierarchical structure
of the mass matrix (\ref{hd24})--(\ref{hd25}) implies that the masses of the $Z'$ boson and  heaviest CP--even Higgs particle
associated with $S_1$ are almost degenerate. Thus the heaviest CP--even Higgs state can be integrated out. The masses of
another CP--even state, which is predominantly $S_4$, CP--odd state, that corresponds to $P_1$, and charged Higgs states
are also almost degenerate in this limit. Assuming that the Higgs state which is mainly $S_4$ is the second heaviest CP--even Higgs
state and neglecting all terms which are proportional to the couplings $\kappa$, $\mu$ and $\Lambda$, that violate global $U(1)$
symmetry, as well as setting $\cos 2\theta=0$ one obtains the following approximate analytic expressions for the tree-level
masses of the three lightest CP--even Higgs bosons:
\be
\ba{lcl}
m_{h_{3,2}}^2 & \simeq & \dfrac{\sigma^2 s^2}{4}\left[1+\dfrac{A_{\sigma}}{\sqrt{2}\sigma \varphi} \pm
\biggl|1 - \dfrac{A_{\sigma}}{\sqrt{2}\sigma \varphi}\biggr|\sqrt{1+16\,\dfrac{\varphi^2}{s^2}}\right]\,,\\[2mm]
m_{h_{1}}^2 & \simeq & \dfrac{\bar{g}^2}{4}v^2\cos^22\beta\simeq M_{Z}^2 \cos^2 2\beta\,.
\ea
\label{hd28}
\ee
Here it is worth pointing out that in the scenario under consideration the tree--level expression for the SM--like Higgs mass
$m_{h_{1}}^2$ is basically the same as in the MSSM.



\section{Nonstandard Higgs decays}

Following our initial motivation, that was discussed in the Introduction, we now focus on the part of the parameter
space which corresponds to the approximate global $U(1)$ symmetry mentioned above. Moreover since
no signal or indication, which can be associated with possible presence of any kind of physics beyond the SM, has been
detected at the LHC so far we assume that all SUSY breaking parameters are of the order of the TeV scale.
In addition we also assume that SM singlet superfields $\overline{S}$, $S$ and $\phi$ acquire very large VEVs
inducing multi-TeV masses of $Z'$ boson and all exotic particles except three lightest inert neutralino states which
remains substantially lighter than $1\,\mbox{eV}$. In this case all superpartners of quarks and leptons gain
TeV-scale masses as well. Our analysis of the Higgs sector performed in the previous section indicates that
Higgs spectrum has in general a very hierarchical structure when all SUSY breaking parameters are sufficiently
large, i.e. $\gtrsim 1\,\mbox{TeV}$. In this limit only SM--like Higgs boson and the lightest CP--odd Higgs state
associated with spontaneously broken approximate global $U(1)$ symmetry can be considerably lighter than
$1\,\mbox{TeV}$.

The presence of light pseudoscalar Higgs state in the particle spectrum can result in the nonstandard decays of the lightest
CP--even Higgs boson in the $U(1)$ extensions of the MSSM under consideration. Expanding
the Higgs potential  (\ref{hd9}) about its physical minimum one can obtain the trilinear coupling that describes the interaction
of the lightest CP--even Higgs scalar with the lightest Higgs pseudoscalar states. At the tree level, the corresponding part
of the Lagrangian can be written as
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}

$$
The interaction Lagrangian (\ref{hd29})--(\ref{hd30}) gives rise to decays of the lightest CP--even Higgs boson into
a pair of lightest pseudoscalars if these sates are lighter than $60\,\mbox{GeV}$. The corresponding partial decay width is given by
\begin{equation}
\Gamma(h_1\to A_1 A_1)=\dfrac{G^2}{8\pi m_{h_1}}\sqrt{1-\dfrac{4 m_{A_1}^2}{m_{h_1}^2}}\,.
\label{hd31}
\end{equation}

In order to compare the partial widths associated with the nonstandard Higgs decays of the SM-like Higgs state (\ref{hd31})
with the Higgs decay rates into the SM particles we specify a set of benchmark points (see Table~2).
For each benchmark scenario we calculate the spectrum of neutralinos and Higgs bosons as well as the couplings
and the branching ratios of the lightest CP-even Higgs state using code generated by FlexibleSUSY \cite{Athron:2014yba}.
To simplify our analysis we set $B=\mu=\xi=0$ and $\Lambda=0$. We also fix $\sigma=0.1$ and $\tan\beta\simeq 10$.
Then, in order to find an appropriate set of benchmark points we vary $\lambda$, $\kappa$, $A_{\kappa}$,
$A_{\lambda}$, $A_{\sigma}$, $\varphi$, $s$ and $\theta$. As one can see from Table~2 in all benchmark scenarios
$m_{S}^2$ and  $m_2^2$ are negative which ensures that Higgs fields $S$ and $H_u$ acquire VEVs
resulting in the non--zero VEVs of other Higgs fields $H_d$, $S$ and $\varphi$. This should trigger the breakdown
of $SU(2)_W\times U(1)_Y\times U(1)_{N}$ symmetry down to $U(1)_{em}$. The soft scalar masses associated with
the superpartners of the left--handed and right--handed components of top quark and mixing in the stop sector are chosen
so that the SM--like Higgs state has a mass around $125-126\,\mbox{GeV}$. In Table 2 the masses of the heavy Higgs states
are computed in the leading one--loop approximation while in the case of the lightest Higgs boson mass the leading
two--loop corrections are taken into account.

To construct benchmark scenarios which are consistent with cosmological observations it is important to guarantee that
they lead to relic densities $\Omega_{\mathrm{CDM}} h^2$ that are not larger than the result given by PLANCK \cite{Ade:2013zuv}:
\be
\Omega_{\mathrm{CDM}} h^2 = 0.1187 \pm 0.0017 \;.
\label{hd32}
\ee
If a theory predicts a greater relic density of dark matter than this then it is basically ruled out, assuming standard pre-BBN
cosmology. A theory that predicts less dark matter cannot be ruled out in the same way but then there would have to be
other contributions to the dark matter relic density. Since the dark matter density is inversely proportional to the annihilation
cross section at the freeze-out temperature, this cross section have to be sufficiently large. In the $E_6$ inspired SUSY models,
that we consider here, the cold dark matter density is formed by the lightest neutralino states. From the first glance
the neutralino sector in these models is more complicated than the one in the MSSM. Indeed, it contains eight states which is
twice larger than in the MSSM. However the analysis of the corresponding neutralino mass matrix, which specified in the Appendix A,
indicates that this matrix has rather simple structure. From Eq.~(\ref{a4}) it follows that the masses of two neutralino states,
which are linear superpositions of $\tilde{B}'$ and $\tilde{S}\cos\theta-\tilde{\overline{S}}\sin\theta$, are controlled by
the $Z'$ boson mass. In the limit when $\lambda$ is small and $M_{Z'}\gg M_S$ these states decouple from the rest of the
sparticle spectrum. As follows from Eq.~(\ref{a4}) two other neutralino eigenstates are formed by the linear superpositions of
$\tilde{S}\sin\theta+\tilde{\overline{S}}\cos\theta$ and $\tilde{\phi}$. In the case when $\kappa\ll \lambda$ and $\sigma$
the masses of these eigenstates are closely approximated as
\be
m_{\chi^0_{5,6}}\simeq = \dfrac{\sigma\varphi}{2\sqrt{2}}\left(1 \pm \sqrt{1+4\,\dfrac{s^2}{\varphi^2}}\right)\sim M_S\,.
\label{hd33}
\ee
When $\lambda$ is small and $M_S\gg M_Z$  the mixing of these states with the MSSM-like neutralino, i.e. $\tilde{H}^0_d$,\,
$\tilde{H}^0_u$,\,$\tilde{W}_3$ and $\tilde{B}$, is also strongly suppressed. Thus if the corresponding neutralino states are
not the lightest ones they can be ignored in the leading approximation. This permits us to reduce $8\times 8$ matrix
(\ref{a2})--(\ref{a5}) to $4\times 4$ mass matrix which is rather similar to the one in the MSSM. In the limit  $M_S\gg M_Z$
the masses of the MSSM-like neutralino states, which are predominantly bino, wino and higgsino, are set by $M_1$, $M_2$
and $\dfrac{\lambda s \cos\theta}{\sqrt{2}}$ respectively\,.

The qualitative pattern of the neutralino spectrum discussed above reveals that for sufficiently small values
of $\lambda$ the lightest neutralino tends to be higgsino dominated state. If this higgsino--like state is lighter than $1\,\mbox{TeV}$
then it leads to the cold dark matter density which is less than its measured value \cite{ArkaniHamed:2006mb}.
Therefore in all benchmark scenarios specified in Table~2 the value of the coupling $\lambda$ is chosen so that the lightest
neutralino is predominantly higgsino with mass below $1\,\mbox{TeV}$ .

Since in all benchmark scenarios $m_{A_1}$ is so small that the decays of the SM--like Higgs state into a pair of the lightest Higgs
pseudoscalars are kinematically allowed it is important to ensure that the lightest CP--odd Higgs boson could not be produced
at the collider experiments before. In this context it is worth noting that in the case of the hierarchical structure of the Higgs spectrum
which is caused by the large SUSY breaking scale the couplings of this state to the SM particles are naturally suppressed. Indeed,
as it was pointed out in the Subsection 3.2 the lightest CP--odd Higgs boson is predominantly a superposition of the imaginary parts
of the SM singlet fields $\overline{S}$, $S$ and $\phi$, that do not couple to the quarks, leptons and SM gauge boson directly, and
the mixing between these singlet fields and the neutral components of Higgs doublets is rather small in this case. As a consequence
in all benchmark scenarios presented in Table~2 the absolute value of the relative coupling of the lightest Higgs pseudoscalar to
the Z-boson and the SM--like Higgs state $R_{Z A_1 h_1}$ is always smaller than $10^{-3}-10^{-4}$. All other couplings of
the lightest CP--odd Higgs boson to the SM particles are extremely small as well. Thus this state cannot be observed in the past
collider experiments.

Due to the hierarchical structure of the Higgs spectrum the lightest SM--like Higgs state has basically the same couplings as in the SM.
For example, in the case of all benchmark points specified in Table~2 the value of the relative coupling of this state to a $Z$ pair
is about $0.99$ or even closer to unity. Therefore the partial decay widths that correspond to the decays of the lightest CP-even
Higgs boson into the SM particles are basically the same as in the SM as well. Because of this, for the calculation of the Higgs decay
rates into the SM particles we use the results presented in \cite{King:2012is} where these rates were computed within the SM for
different values of the Higgs mass. When $m_{h_1}\simeq 125\,\mbox{GeV}$ the SM-like Higgs state decays predominantly
into $b$-quark. In the SM the corresponding branching ratio is about $60\%$ whereas the branching ratios associated with
Higgs decays into $WW$, $ZZ$ and $\gamma\gamma$ are about $20\%$, $2.1\%$ and $0.23\%$ respectively \cite{King:2012is}.
The total decay width of the Higgs boson near 125 GeV is about $4\,\mbox{MeV}$.

For the calculation of the SM--like Higgs decay rates into $A_1 A_1$ we use Eq.~(\ref{hd31}). The set of the benchmark points
specified in Table~2 demonstrates that the branching ratio of these nonstandard Higgs decays can vary from $0.1\%$ to $20-30\%$
The lightest CP-odd Higgs state, that originate from such decays of the SM--like Higgs boson, predominantly decay into
either a pair of $b$--quarks (i.e. $b\bar{b}$) or $\tau$--leptons (i.e. $\tau\bar{\tau}$) giving rise to four fermion final state.
From Table~2 one can see that the branching ratios of the decays of the lightest CP--even Higgs boson into a pair of lightest
Higgs pseudoscalars depend rather strongly on the absolute value of coupling $\kappa$. Reasonably large branching ratios, ($\sim 1\%$)
of these Higgs decays can be obtained when $\kappa\simeq 0.01$. However in order to get pseudoscalar with mass $40-60\,\mbox{GeV}$
in this case a fine-tuning of order $1\%$ is needed. As follows from Eqs.~(\ref{hd21}) so small $m_{A_1}$ can be always obtained by
means of tuning of the parameter $A_{\kappa}$. The degree of tuning is illustrated in Fig.~1, in which the region of the parameter space
in the plane $(\kappa,\, A_{\kappa})$, that leads to the appropriately small $m_{A_1}$ and nonstandard Higgs decays, is shown.
One can see that with decreasing of $\kappa$ the range of $A_{\kappa}$, which results in the sufficiently small $m_{A_1}$, becomes
considerably wider that corresponds to smaller degree of fine-tuning.

From Fig.~1 and Table~2 it is easy to see that the branching ratios of the decays of the SM--like
Higgs boson into a pair of the pseudoscalar Higgs states become smaller when $\kappa$ decreases.
This is not so surprising result. Indeed, if $\kappa=0$ the invariance of the Lagrangian with respect to
a shift symmetry, i.e. $A_1\to A_1 + C$, where $C$ is a constant, forbids any interaction of the goldstone
mode with the SM-like Higgs field of the type  (\ref{hd29})--(\ref{hd30}). Thus one can expect that small
values of $\kappa$ lead to small branching ratios of the nonstandard Higgs decays mentioned above.
When $\kappa\sim 0.001$ the pseudoscalar state with mass $40-60\,\mbox{GeV}$ can be obtained
almost without fine-tuning. However in this case the branching ratio of the nonstandard Higgs decays
tends to be of the order of $10^{-3}-10^{-4}$.

\section{Conclusions}

In this paper we considered the nonstandard decays of the SM--like Higgs state within the $U(1)$ extensions
of the MSSM. In the simplest SUSY models with additional $U(1)$ gauge symmetry the mass of the $Z'$ boson
associated with the extra $U(1)$ interaction tends to be of the order of SUSY breaking scale. The stringent
lower bounds on the masses of different gauge bosons set by the LHC experiments imply that sparticle
have multi--TeV masses in these models. It results in a significant degree of fine-tuning which is needed
to stabilise the EW scale. This fine-tuning can be alleviated within the $U(1)$ SUSY extensions of the SM
in which the extra $U(1)$ gauge symmetry is broken by two VEVs of the SM singlet fields $S$ and $\overline{S}$
with opposite $U(1)$ charges. Because in this case $S$ and $\overline{S}$ can acquire very large VEVs along
the $D$--flat direction the $Z'$--boson can be naturally substantially heavier than SUSY particles that
allows to satisfy all the experimental constraints. Moreover such SUSY models can possess an approximate
global $U(1)$ symmetry that gets spontaneously broken by the VEVs of $S$ and $\overline{S}$ leading
to the pseudo--Goldstone boson in the particle spectrum. If the corresponding pseudoscalar state is considerably
lighter than the lightest CP--even Higgs state then it may give rise to the decays of the SM-like Higgs particle
into a pair of the pseudo--Goldstone bosons.

Here we studied such decays within well motivated SUSY extensions of the SM based on the
$SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_W\times U(1)_Y\times U(1)_{N}\times Z_{2}^{M}$ symmetry. The low energy matter
content of these $E_6$ inspired models includes three $27$ representations of $E_6$, a pair of $SU(2)_W$ doublets
$L_4$ and $\overline{L}_4$, a pair of the SM singlets $S$ and $\overline{S}$ with opposite $U(1)_{N}$ charges,
as well as SM singlet $\phi$ that does not participate in the gauge interactions. The low--energy spectrum of the
SUSY models being considered here, in particular, involves three families of Higgs--like doublets $H^{d}_{i}$ and
$H^{u}_{i}$ and three families of exotic quarks $D_i$ and $\bar{D}_i$. To suppress flavour changing processes
at the tree--level as well as the most dangerous baryon and lepton number violating operators an extra
$\tilde{Z}^{H}_2$ discrete symmetry is imposed. Under this symmetry one pair of Higgs--like doublet
supermultiplets ($H_u$ and $H_d$) as well as $L_4$, $\overline{L}_4$, $S$, $\overline{S}$ and $\phi$ are even
while all other superfields are odd. Fields $H_u$, $H_d$, $S$, $\overline{S}$ and $\phi$ form a Higgs sector
in these SUSY models. They acquire VEVs breaking gauge symmetry and inducing masses of the exotic particles.
In the simplest phenomenologically viable scenarios the lightest SUSY states are expected to be substantially lighter
than $1\,\mbox{eV}$ in these $E_6$ inspired SUSY models so that they form hot dark matter in the Universe.
Since these states are so light they give only minor contribution to the dark matter density. Because of the conservation
of the $Z^{M}_2$ and $\tilde{Z}^{H}_2$ symmetries the lightest neutralino can be also absolutely stable and
may account for all or some of the observed cold dark matter density.

We analysed the spectrum of the CP--even and CP--odd Higgs bosons in these $E_6$ inspired models
assuming that all SUSY breaking parameters are of the order of the TeV scale. Expanding the Higgs potential
we obtained analytical expression for the coupling of the lightest CP--even Higgs state to a pair of the lightest
Higgs pseudoscalars. The dependence of the branching ratio of the nonstandard Higgs decays mentioned above
on the parameters in these SUSY models was examined. For simplicity, we assumed that only one coupling
in the superpotential which explicitly breaks global $U(1)$ symmetry has non--zero value. If this dimensionless
coupling $\kappa$ varies from $0.1$ to $1$ the global symmetry is entirely broken. When $\kappa$ vanishes
the global $U(1)$ symmetry is restored.

In order to illustrate the results of our analysis we
specified a set of the benchmark scenarios with the SM--like Higgs mass around $125-126\,\mbox{GeV}$.
To ensure that the obtained benchmark points are consistent with the measured value of the cold dark matter
density we chose the parameters so that the lightest neutralino is mainly higgsino with mass below $1\,\mbox{TeV}$.
In this case the dark matter density tends to be smaller than its observed value. The results of our analysis indicate
that the couplings of the lightest Higgs pseudoscalar to the SM particles are always quite small. As a consequence
although this pseudoscalar state is rather light it could escape detection at former and present collider experiments.

We argued that the branching ratio of the decays of the lightest CP--even Higgs boson into a pair of the lightest
pseudoscalars depends rather strongly on the absolute value of coupling $\kappa$. When $\kappa\gtrsim 0.01$
the branching ratio of the nonstandard Higgs decays can be larger than $1\%$. Nonetheless a fine tuning of at least
$1\%$ is required in this case to get the lightest pseudoscalar state with mass $40-60\,\mbox{GeV}$.
After being produced the lightest CP-odd Higgs states sequentially decay into a pair of either $b$--quarks or
$\tau$--leptons. Thus these decays of the lightest CP--even Higgs boson result in the four fermion final state.

For the absolute values of $\kappa$ which are substantially smaller than $0.01$ the branching ratio of the
nonstandard Higgs decays decreases considerably. Indeed, in the limit when $\kappa$ goes to zero the
global $U(1)$ symmetry is spontaneously broken and the Lagrangian of these $E_6$ inspired models should be
invariant with respect to the shift symmetry transformations associated with the massless axion. As a result the
couplings of the lightest Higgs pseudoscalar becomes extremely suppressed and the branching ratio of the
nonstandard Higgs decays tends to be negligibly small. Therefore although for $\kappa\sim 0.001$ the lightest
pseudoscalar with mass $40-60\,\mbox{GeV}$ can be obtained almost without fine-tuning the branching ratio
of the SM--like Higgs decays into a pair of the  lightest CP--odd state is smaller than $10^{-3}-10^{-4}$.
So small branching ratios of the nonstandard decays of the SM--like Higgs boson can be rather problematic
to measure at the LHC.

\section{Neutralino mass matrix}
\setcounter{equation}{0}
\def\theequation{A.\arabic{equation}}

After the breakdown of gauge symmetry in the $E_6$ inspired SUSY models under consideration
all superpartners of the gauge and Higgs bosons get non--zero masses. Because extra vector
superfield associated with the $Z'$ boson and extra SM singlet Higgs superfields
$\overline{S}$, $S$ and $\phi$ are electromagnetically neutral they do not contribute any
extra particles to the chargino spectrum. As a consequence the chargino mass matrix and
its eigenvalues remain almost the same as in the MSSM, i.e.
\be
\ba{rcl}
m^2_{\chi^{\pm}_{1,\,2}}&=&\ds\frac{1}{2}\biggl[M_2^2+\mu_{eff}^2+2 M^2_{W}\pm\biggl.\\[2mm]
&&\biggr.\qquad\qquad\qquad\sqrt{(M_2^2+\mu^2_{eff}+2M^2_{W})^2-4(M_2\mu_{eff}-M^2_{W}\sin 2\beta)^2}
\biggr]\,,
\ea
\label{a1}
\ee
where $M_2$ is the $SU(2)_W$ gaugino mass and $\mu_{eff}=\ds\frac{\lambda s \cos\theta}{\sqrt{2}}$.
The non-observation of the lightest chargino at the collider experiments implies that
$|M_2|$, $|\mu_{eff}|\gtrsim 100\,\mbox{GeV}$.

The neutralino sector of the SUSY models under consideration involves four extra neutralinos besides
the four MSSM ones. One of them $\tilde{B}'$ is an extra gaugino coming from the $Z'$ vector superfield.
Three other states are fermion components $\tilde{S}$, $\tilde{\overline{S}}$ and $\tilde{\phi}$
of the SM singlet Higgs superfields $\overline{S}$, $S$ and $\phi$. In the basis
$(\tilde{H}^0_d,\,\tilde{H}^0_u,\,\tilde{W}_3,\,\tilde{B},\,\tilde{B}',\,\tilde{S}\cos\theta-\tilde{\overline{S}}\sin\theta,\,\tilde{S}\sin\theta+\tilde{\overline{S}}\cos\theta,\,\tilde{\phi})$
the neutralino mass matrix can be written as
\be
M_{\tilde{\chi}^0}=
\left(

where $M_1$, $M_2$ and $M'_1$ are the soft gaugino masses for $\tilde{B}$,
$\tilde{W}_3$ and $\tilde{B}'$ respectively. Here we neglect the Abelian
gaugino mass mixing $M_{11}$ between $\tilde{B}$ and $\tilde{B}'$.
The top--left $4\times 4$ block of the mass matrix (\ref{a2}) contains the
neutralino mass matrix of the MSSM where the parameter $\mu$ is replaced
by $\mu_{eff}$. The lower right $4\times 4$ submatrix represents extra
neutralino states in this SUSY model.
